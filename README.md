# Telco-Churn-Analysis
"Churn prediction and business insights project using SQL, Python,Power BI and GenAI

Summary
This project tackles the challenge of **customer churn** for a fictional telecom provider.  
Using **SQL** for querying and EDA, **Python** for data prep and predictive modeling, and **Power BI** for interactive storytelling while leveraging **GenAi** , it delivers:
- **Predictive churn scores** for every customer
- **Actionable insights** into churn drivers

 Business Problem
Customer churn directly impacts revenue and growth.  
By predicting churn and understanding its drivers, the business can **proactively retain customers** and **reduce revenue loss**.

Workflow
**Data Pipeline â†’ Model Training â†’ Business Insights â†’ Model Validation**

1. **Data Extraction and Analysis (SQL)** â€” Pull customer, contract, and service data, Perform Explaratory Data Analysis
2. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering (Python)** â€” Handle missing values, encode categories, create businessâ€‘first KPIs.
3. **Model Training (Random Forest)** â€” Predict churn probability for each customer.
4. **Evaluation** â€” ROC AUC, precision, recall, accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve.
5. **Visualization (Power BI)** â€” Interactive dashboards for decisionâ€‘makers.

---

Key Insights
- **Monthâ€‘toâ€‘month contracts** have the highest churn rate.
- **Electronic check payments** correlate with higher churn.
- **Tenure** is a strong retention indicator â€” longerâ€‘term customers churn less.
- Model ROC AUC: **0.91** â€” strong predictive performance.
